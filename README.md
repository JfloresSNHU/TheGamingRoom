# TheGamingRoom

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The client was The Gaming Room and they were creating a game called Draw It or Lose It. They wanted to make the game a software to be used on multiple platforms with expanding to mobile OS as well as PC compatability.


What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I beleive did all the organizing of the data pretty well in this documentation. Also making sure to clearly state my ideas with examples to have the client fully understand my reccommendations overall.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

I found that working through a design document it makes it easier to develop code that reflects the design that was formulated first. It makes me think of all the decision branching code that is needed and all the logic and functions that need to be coded as well just by looking at the design document.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I think I would revise the section on the Executive Summary. I would improve it by including some more information on the clients requirements and overall vision for the ask the the client is making for us to deliver on. Including more details in the executive summary sets the entire design document up for success and not have any details missing moving forward.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I was able to interpret the users needs into my software design by laying out the requirments one by one and isolating everything that needed to be done. It is important to consider the users needs when designing because ultimately they are the end users of the product and if its made to thier liking then the project is a success.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I approached designing software by first writing a psuedocode sheet with most of the logic and functionality that would be needed along with a UML Diagram to refelct on these software needs. Then after this it was easy to model all the code into classes and get all the paramenters and functions needed for the sofware. I would use the same techniques in the future to design a similar software being that this process proved very effective for me.
